# Adaptive modular blockchain (AMBC)  

AMBC is implemented in MATLAB and also has Python version to facilitate blockchain applications in cloud environment (AWS and Azure). 
It currently supports Proof of Authority (PoA) and BFT-Smart consensus mechanisms.

AMBC performance can be scalable to address PB data flow requirements and adapted for specific user needs. 
The high-level AMBC architecture is shown in figure.
